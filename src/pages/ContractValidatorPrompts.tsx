## High-Risk Issues
- **Termination Clause (Section 8.2)**: Allows the other party to terminate without cause with only 7 days notice, which is unusually short and creates business continuity risk.
- **Liability Cap (Section 12.1)**: Caps your liability but not the other party's liability, creating an unfair imbalance in risk allocation.

## Medium-Risk Issues
- **Payment Terms (Section 4.3)**: 45-day payment window is longer than industry standard (30 days).
- **IP Assignment (Section 10.1)**: Overly broad language could unintentionally transfer rights to pre-existing IP.
- **Force Majeure (Section 14)**: Definition is narrower than standard clauses, potentially limiting protection.

## Low-Risk Issues
- **Notice Provision (Section 16.2)**: Requires physical mail for notices, which is outdated.
- **Assignment (Section 15.1)**: Requires consent for assignment but doesn't specify that consent won't be unreasonably withheld.

## Missing Provisions
- No data protection or privacy clause
- No alternative dispute resolution mechanism
- No audit rights

## Recommendations
1. Negotiate longer termination notice period (minimum 30 days)
2. Add mutual liability caps with reasonable amounts
3. Reduce payment terms to net-30
4. Add exclusion for pre-existing IP
5. Expand force majeure definition to include standard events`;

        response = `# Indemnification Clause Explanation

## What This Clause Means in Simple Terms
This indemnification clause requires you to protect the other company from financial losses if certain bad things happen that are your fault. Think of it like insurance â€“ you're promising to pay for damages if you cause problems.

## Key Points in Plain Language
- You must pay for any losses, damages, or legal costs the other company faces if:
  - You break the contract
  - You infringe someone's intellectual property
  - You or your employees are negligent
  - You break any laws

## Is This Balanced?
No, this clause is one-sided. It requires you to indemnify the other party, but there's no matching requirement for them to indemnify you. In a balanced contract, indemnification would be mutual.

## Unusual Aspects
The clause has no financial cap on your potential liability, which is concerning. Most standard indemnification clauses include some limit on the amount you might have to pay.

## Practical Impact
If you sign this as written, you could face unlimited financial liability for a wide range of issues, even for problems that are only partially your fault.

## Suggested Improvements
1. Make the indemnification mutual (both parties should indemnify each other)
2. Add a financial cap on indemnification (e.g., limited to fees paid under the contract)
3. Add a time limit for indemnification claims
4. Narrow the scope to cover only things directly within your control`;
      } else {
        response = `# Contract Analysis Summary

## Overview
This appears to be a Service Agreement between a service provider and a client. The contract is 12 pages long with 18 sections covering standard business terms.

## Key Obligations
- **Service Provider**: Deliver services described in Exhibit A, maintain insurance, provide monthly reports
- **Client**: Pay fees according to schedule, provide necessary information and access, review deliverables within 5 business days

## Payment Terms
- $10,000 monthly retainer
- Additional services billed at $150/hour
- 45-day payment window (longer than standard 30 days)
- 1.5% late fee per month on overdue amounts

## Duration and Termination
- 12-month initial term with automatic renewal
- Client can terminate without cause with 30 days notice
- Either party can terminate for material breach with 15 days notice and opportunity to cure

## Major Risks
1. Broad IP assignment language could transfer rights to pre-existing materials
2. One-sided indemnification favoring the client
3. No liability cap for service provider
4. Vague acceptance criteria for deliverables

## Unusual Terms
- Non-compete extends to client's potential future competitors
- Client can withhold final payment until all acceptance criteria are met, without clear timeline
- Governing law is Delaware (unusual if neither party is based there)

## Recommendations
1. Add mutual indemnification provisions
2. Include liability caps for both parties
3. Clarify deliverable acceptance process and timeline
4. Narrow IP assignment to exclude pre-existing materials
5. Reduce payment terms to industry-standard 30 days`;
